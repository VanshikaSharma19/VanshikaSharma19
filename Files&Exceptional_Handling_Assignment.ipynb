        "#Isolation: Errors are handled within the task's scope, preventing them from affecting other tasks.\n",
        "#Flexibility: You can tailor error handling to the specific type of exception and task logic.\n",

        "2. Error Handling with 'concurrent.futures' : concurrent.futures provides tools for error handling:\n",
        "    1. future.result(): This method will raise any exception that occurred in the task. You can wrap it in a try-except block to handle it. The example above demonstrates this.\n",
        "    2. future.exception(): This method returns the exception object if one occurred, otherwise None. You can use this to check for errors without raising them immediately.\n",
        "#Centralized Error Handling: You can collect results and handle errors in the main thread after tasks are completed.\n",
        "#Exception Propagation: Exceptions from worker threads/processes are propagated to the main thread, making them visible.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Custom Exception Classes:\n",
        " You can create exceptions that are meaningful within your application's context.\n",
        " Allows you to catch specific types of errors related to your tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Logging:\n",
